Tell every agent on this Room host the things you would otherwise repeat in each thread. Examples: your coding conventions, the tools you prefer, and the projects it should know about.

## What you get

- One text field in Settings, up to 4,096 characters.
- The text is added to the instructions of every agent task on this host, for every provider and every project.
- Changes apply to the next task. You do not restart anything.

## How it works

Write the instructions as plain text or Markdown. Leave the field empty to add nothing. Room appends your text to the instructions it already gives the agent.

## For agents and scripts

Use the `room instructions` command:

- `room instructions get` prints the current text.
- `room instructions set <text...>` replaces it.
- `room instructions clear` removes it.

Add `--json` for machine-readable output.
